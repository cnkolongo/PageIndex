The main points covered are:\n\n1.  **Mandatory Authorization and Fees:** It stipulates that all mechanical reproduction, printing, or duplication of copyrighted literary, artistic, and musical works requires prior authorization from the organization SOCODA COOP-CA, subject to the payment of administrative fees. This applies to entities like printers, phonographic/videographic plants, and textile factories.\n\n2.  **Scope of Reproduction:** It defines operations like downloading or burning (gravure) copyrighted works as acts of reproduction. Entities facilitating such online downloads or burns for end consumers are liable to pay copyright and related rights royalties to SOCODA COOP-CA.\n\n3.  **Control and Accounting Requirements:** Reproduction units must submit monthly reports and delivery slips to SOCODA COOP-CA. They are required to maintain transparent analytical accounting for royalties to enable verification. Operating without authorization is prohibited and subject to sanctions.\n\n4.  **Private Copying Remuneration:** It establishes a remuneration scheme for private copying, referencing relevant national copyright law. The levy applies to blank analog and digital media (like tapes, CDs, DVDs) and to devices capable of recording sounds/images (such as mobile phones, computers). SOCODA COOP-CA collects this remuneration with the collaboration of the Directorate General of Customs and Excises (DGDA).",

A specific procedure is required for using protected works (photographs, drawings) in fixed-image advertisements.\n2.  **State Sovereignty over Certain Works:** It defines works of \"public order\" (national hymns, coats of arms, official portraits, technical studies, etc.) as falling under state sovereignty, where the state holds exclusive exploitation rights. The state acquires these works through commissions or legal means.\n3.  **Compensation for State-Used Works:** Despite the state's monopoly, it must pay a unique royalty to the author or rights holders for public use of these sovereign works. For long-term use, the state negotiates a lifelong annuity based on a quarter of the global royalty.\n4.  **Royalty Calculation:** The royalty amount is determined using a technical assessment sheet prepared by a sworn expert.\n5.  **Registration Requirement for Reproduction:** It mandates that all production units (record/video factories, printers, textile manufacturers, etc.) reproducing musical, literary, or artistic works within the Congo must register with SOCODA COOP-CA to avoid legal prosecution.",
