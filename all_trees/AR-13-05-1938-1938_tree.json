                "summary": "This partial document is a legal text, specifically a Belgian Royal Decree from 1938 concerning indigenous jurisdictions in what was then the Belgian Congo (later Zaire, now DRC). It has been amended by decrees from 1959.\n\nThe main points covered in this excerpt are:\n\n1.  **Legal Basis and Coordination:** It states that the decree coordinates previous decrees on indigenous jurisdictions.\n\n2.  **Types of Indigenous Courts:** It lists the six regular indigenous courts: Tribunal of Chieftaincy, Tribunal of Sector, Tribunal of Center, Tribunal of Commune, Tribunal of Territory, and Tribunal of City.\n\n3.  **Jurisdiction (Ressort):** It defines the geographical area over which each type of court has authority, from a specific chieftaincy or sector to an entire territory or city.\n\n4.  **Composition of Courts:** It outlines how judges are appointed or designated for the different tribunals. Key points include:\n    *   The composition of chieftaincy courts is determined by custom, but with provisions for the chief and colonial authorities to appoint additional members.\n    *   Sector Tribunal judges are appointed by colonial authorities, with the sector chief serving as president by right.\n    *   Rules for quorum in sector tribunals are specified.\n    *   The composition of center and commune tribunals is determined by appointment by colonial authorities.\n\nThe text reflects a colonial legal structure that incorporates customary authorities (chiefs, notables) but places ultimate control over the institution, jurisdiction, and composition of these courts in the hands of Belgian colonial administrators (the District Commissioner or First Burgomaster).",

Article 38 outlines how court costs, fines, and confiscations are collected and allocated by different types of tribunals (e.g., chefferie, commune, territory, city), and how the operational expenses of these courts are funded.",

The main points covered are:\n\n1.  **Jurisdictional Primacy:** European tribunals always have precedence over indigenous tribunals, though they may refer cases back to the indigenous tribunal.\n2.  **Applicable Law for Indigenous Tribunals:** Indigenous tribunals primarily apply local customs, provided they are not contrary to universal public order. However, they must apply written legal or regulatory provisions that have been enacted to replace custom.\n3.  **Sentencing Under Custom:** It details the penalties (imprisonment, fines, confiscation) that indigenous tribunals can impose for offenses defined only by custom, setting specific maximum limits.\n4.  **Choice of Penalty:** When an act is considered an offense under both custom and written law, the indigenous tribunal may choose to apply the penalties from either system, within its jurisdictional limits.\n5.  **Enforcement:** It includes provisions for enforcing judgments, such as awarding fines or confiscated property to victims, and imposing corporal constraint (imprisonment) for up to one month on individuals who refuse to comply with a tribunal's ruling.",

Procedures for issuing and executing warrants to bring a defendant who fails to appear personally before the court.\n4.
