This responsibility is definitive and cannot be transferred. Specific rules are outlined for workers employed successively by multiple employers.\n\n2.  **Payment Deadlines and Penalties:** Contributions must be credited to the Fund's account within 15 days following the relevant calendar month. Failure to pay on time results in a penalty and requires regularization within a short grace period. In cases of cessation of activity, all due contributions become immediately payable.\n\n3.  **Accepted Payment Methods:** Contributions can be paid via bank transfer, cash deposit slip, cheque, or in cash at the Fund's counter. Any payment must specify key details like the employer's name, affiliation number, period, and amount.\n\n4.  **Collection Procedures for Unpaid Sums:** The collection process is initiated by the Fund sending a certified account statement to the employer, which serves as a formal demand for payment. This statement must contain specific information about the employer and the debt.\n\n5.  **Escalation to Enforcement:** If the employer does not comply within eight days of receiving the demand, the Fund can issue an authenticated certificate of debt. Once approved by the relevant Minister, this certificate becomes an enforceable title, allowing for seizure and other recovery measures as per OHADA uniform law.

Eligibility requires the insured woman to be registered with the fund for at least 12 months before the presumed delivery date and to cease all salaried work during the 14-week leave period (6 weeks before and 8 weeks after delivery).\n\n2. **Required Procedures and Documentation**: Detailed instructions are given for submitting the maternity allowance application (form F7), including distribution of copies and required information about the insured woman, employer, and beneficiary. The process requires supporting documents such as pay slips, a medical certificate, employer notification, and, upon return to work, documents like a birth certificate and employer attestation. Procedures for extension of leave are also described.\n\n3. **Calculation and Duration of the Allowance**: The allowance is paid for 14 weeks, contingent on cessation of work. It may be extended for up to three additional weeks if medically justified due to pregnancy or childbirth-related illness.",

The main points covered are:\n\n*   **Payment Frequency:** Benefits are generally paid quarterly, but monthly payments or other arrangements can be determined by the fund's administration.\n*   **Payment Processing:** The fund transmits funds and detailed beneficiary lists (including names, addresses, decision numbers, and amounts due) to payment centers and banks, which can be done electronically.\n*   **Reporting and Reconciliation:** Payment centers must return proof of payments, unpaid amounts, and reasons for non-payment within three months, with a partial report required after 45 days. Banks report within three months, and all entities must return any leftover funds to designated accounts.\n*   **Temporary Disability Benefits:** These are paid at the same regular intervals as wages (weekly to monthly), directly to the beneficiary, spouse, or an authorized proxy. Employers who continue paying an incapacitated employee are subrogated to the employee's rights to the allowance if they are up-to-date on social contributions.\n*   **Change of Address:** Beneficiaries must notify their payment center of any address change using a specific form or letter, accompanied by copies of identification and the social benefit certificate.\n*   **Physical Verification:** Pension/annuity beneficiaries must undergo a physical check at their payment center at the start of each semester. Orphan beneficiaries must do so during the first quarter of each year, with required documents (birth certificate or certificate of life) specified based on the child's age (under 6 or at least 6 years old).",

It specifies that when a beneficiary is entitled to both a permanent disability annuity and an invalidity pension due to a work-related illness, only the annuity is paid, with a supplemental payment if the pension amount is higher. Similar rules apply to survivor benefits. It details how multiple pensions or annuities are combined, typically granting the highest benefit plus half of the other. The document also covers the continuation of family allowances for survivors, the cessation and resumption of various pensions when conditions change, and the transition from daily accident benefits to permanent disability annuities. It establishes procedures for reviewing and adjusting invalidity pensions based on periodic medical examinations.",

The main points are:\n\n1.  **Obligations of the Beneficiary:** The insured person cannot refuse required medical exams (risk of pension suspension) and must comply with administrative formalities and use provided medical/rehabilitation services.\n\n2.  **Time Limits for Revision and Prescription:**\n    *   Limits are set for revising a disability assessment (5, 10, or 15 years depending on cause).\n    *   Strict prescription (statute of limitation) periods are defined for claiming different benefits (e.g., 1 year for daily allowances, 10 years for pensions).\n\n3.  **Grounds for Suspension or Denial of Benefits:** Rights can be suspended for non-compliance or lost if the event was caused by an intentional fault or an infraction of social security regulations. However, survivors may still receive half the benefits in case of death.\n\n4.  **Third-Party Liability:** If an event is due to a third party's fault, the fund pays the insured but is subrogated to their rights to seek recovery from that third party. The employer is only considered a liable third party in cases of intentional harm.\n\n5.  **Payment Rules for Accrued Rights:** Unclaimed liquidated benefits expire after 1 or 3 years depending on the type. Arrears for pensions/rentes are not paid for periods more than six months prior to the application date.\n\n6.  **Pension Rules:** A person receiving an early pension cannot also claim a retirement pension. If a pensioner resumes salaried activity, their pension is suspended and their new earnings are subject to contributions.",

Family allowances are completely non-attachable and non-transferable.\n2.  **Exemption from Fees:** Documents required to obtain benefits are exempt from all duties and must be issued free of charge.\n3.  **Penalties for Fraud:** It establishes penalties for anyone who intentionally makes false declarations to obtain benefits or advantages for themselves or others, referencing specific legislation.\n4.  **Continuity and Valorization of Benefits:** It states that granted pensions, annuities, and family benefits continue to be paid under the conditions of the awarding decision. Any potential increase in benefit values is determined by a ministerial order.\n5.  **Administrative Provisions:** The text includes standard legal clauses regarding the effective date of the decree (January 1, 2019), the abrogation of contrary prior provisions, and the official (Director General of the National Social Security Fund) charged with its execution.",
