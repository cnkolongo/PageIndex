Special rules apply for classified/secret documents, codes, and specific vital registers (notarial, civil status), for which the post chief bears direct responsibility.\n3.  **Filing System:** Requires each matter to have a distinct, numbered file with a title. Files must remain complete and unified. Large files should have a content summary.\n4.  **Correspondence Procedures:** Establishes rules for numbering diplomatic correspondence (using annual indicator and special order numbers), referencing previous communications, and clearly noting the subject and number of annexes on each letter.\n5.  **Miscellaneous Rules:** Includes guidelines for handling annexes (including translations for foreign language documents) and procedures for announcing shipments to the foreign affairs department.",
