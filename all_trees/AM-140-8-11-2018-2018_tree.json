The decree outlines a detailed list of general prevention principles to be applied, such as avoiding risks, combating risks at source, and prioritizing collective protection. It also specifies the duties of the Caisse, including developing prevention programs, educating workers, enforcing legal prescriptions, controlling prevention measures, exploiting research, conducting campaigns, collecting statistical data on accidents and illnesses, and investigating health conditions.",

It details the mandatory establishment of three key entities within companies: a Health Service, a Special Security/Hygiene/Workplace Improvement Service, and a corresponding Committee. It specifies the preventive missions and specific tasks of each entity. It assigns clear responsibilities to both employers (direct responsibility for OSH measures) and workers (obligation to comply). It also mandates the creation of an annual OSH action plan and requires the Committee's annual activity report to be submitted to the relevant authorities. Additionally, it grants the overseeing \"Caisse\" (Fund) the authority to seek expert advice and to incentivize employers through competitions to integrate occupational risk prevention into their management policies.",

            "summary": "This partial document covers articles from a legal or regulatory text (likely a labor code or social security decree) concerning occupational health, safety, and workplace risk prevention. The main points are:\n\n1.  **Declaration of High-Risk Work:** Employers using hazardous processes must declare them to the labor inspectorate and social security fund, detailing the risks and protective measures.\n2.  **Investigations and Inspections:** The social security fund is empowered to conduct investigations and workplace visits through sworn prevention officers/controllers, who have judicial police powers. Inspections are mandatory in cases of fatal or severe accidents, or to determine the occupational nature of an incident.\n3.  **Confidentiality:** The prevention officers are bound by professional secrecy and must not disclose trade secrets learned during inspections.\n4.  **Financial Incentives and Penalties:** A national competition is mentioned to reward exemplary workplace safety committees. Conversely, the professional risk contribution rate can be doubled for employers who fail to comply with health and safety regulations.\n5.  **Non-Compliance Procedure:** The process for penalizing non-compliant employers is outlined, involving a prior inspection, notification of hazards, debate on corrective measures, and recourse to an expert (at the employer's expense) in case of disagreement.\n6.  **Formal Notification and Deadlines:** Corrective measures agreed upon must be formally notified to the employer in writing, with specified execution deadlines.\n7.  **Consequences of Inaction:** The text cuts off while describing the consequences for an employer's failure to initiate corrective measures.",
