The main points covered are:\n\n1.  **Legal Basis:** It begins by listing the constitutional, treaty, and legal texts that serve as the foundation for the decree.\n2.  **Eligibility and Payment:** It states that family allowances are granted to the insured person for each dependent child and are paid to the insured for the children's benefit.\n3.  **Safeguards for Children:** It allows the social security fund (CNSS) to petition a court to designate a new recipient if the allowances are not used in the children's interest.\n4.  **Rules to Prevent Duplication:** It establishes that when parents are under different schemes, the more advantageous one applies. It explicitly forbids both parents from receiving the allowance for the same child.\n5.  **Amount:** It sets the monthly allowance at 8,100 Congolese francs per child.\n6.  **Payment Method and Frequency:** It specifies that payments are made directly by the fund, either via bank transfer or cash, typically at the end of each calendar quarter, with a possibility for monthly payment.\n7.  **Cessation and Exceptions:** It states that allowances stop if the insured's professional activity ceases. However, they continue during a suspension of the work contract due to illness, accident, pregnancy, childbirth, or incarceration.",

The main points covered are:\n\n*   The conditions under which an insured person is considered to have interrupted professional activity, specifically the cessation of social contribution declarations and payments.\n*   The suspension and resumption of family allowance payments based on the payment status of social contributions.\n*   The continuation of family allowances for workers with temporary or permanent (66% or more) incapacity due to work-related accidents or occupational diseases, with rules for cases where they resume paid work.\n*   The specific cases that interrupt the right to family allowances for each child (e.g., stopping school, reaching age 25, marriage, death, or no longer residing in the country).\n*   Provisions for the payment of allowances in the month of a child's death and for the lump-sum payment of arrears when an employer pays social contributions several months late.\n*   The effective date of the decree (January 1, 2019), the abrogation of contrary prior provisions, and the official responsible for its execution.",
