It explicitly prohibits discrimination based on race, nationality, sex, etc., for these workers.\n\n2.  **Definitions of Relevant Institutions:** It provides legal definitions for the types of educational and training establishments (Article 2) and for who qualifies as a \"trainee\" (Article 3).\n\n3.  **Transfer of Employer Obligations:** It specifies which entity assumes the legal obligations of an \"employer\" (such as contributions and declarations) towards the National Social Security Fund for each category of assimilated worker. This includes masters for apprentices, managing bodies of institutions, the State, and detention center heads.\n\n4.  **Registration Procedures:** It mandates that the responsible employer must register an assimilated worker with the competent territorial social security office within 15 working days, using a specific form (Model IMTA).\n\n5.  **Registration Form Content:** It details the specific information required on the Model IMTA form, split into data about the employer (name, registration number, address) and data about the assimilated worker (personal details, identification documents, origin).",
