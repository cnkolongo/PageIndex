The procedures differ based on whether the judgment is final or interlocutory.\n\n3.  **Providing information to parties and interested persons:** This includes regulations on the delivery of copies and communication of criminal/disciplinary files (under the authority of the Prosecutor General) and obligations for the investigating magistrate to inform complainants about the outcome of their complaint (e.g., closure, settlement fine, or decision to prosecute).\n\n4.  **Documents and reports to be sent to the Prosecutor General:** Detailed instructions are given for distributing multiple copies of notices of case opening and closing notes, as well as judgments. Specific rules apply for sending copies of judgments involving acquittals or sentences over one year, including exceptions when an appeal is lodged.",

It details procedures for restitution if the seizure is lifted, or for transfer to the court registry if prosecution proceeds, explicitly forbidding deposit into public accounts in these cases.\n\n3.  **Handling of Other Funds (e.g., Damages):** It outlines procedures for when court officers hold funds like court-awarded damages. If the beneficiary is present, the officer acts as an intermediary for immediate payment. If absent, the funds are deposited with a public accountant (the court clerk) for later disbursement to the rightful claimant.",

It also requires appeals when sentences are deemed disproportionate and obligates the prosecutor to ensure timely applications for conditional release for eligible convicts.\n\n3.  **Prison Competence and Production (Compétence pénitentiaire):** It details the responsibility of prosecutors to oversee prison labor and \"penitentiary production.\" It establishes a reporting chain where prison wardens submit quarterly production reports to prosecutors, who then compile annual reports for the central justice administration to monitor trends and improvements.",
